    "## When Should I Use Feature Scaling?\n",
    "\n",
    "In many machine learning algorithms, the result will change depending on the units of your data. This is especially true in two specific cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **When your algorithm uses a distance-based metric to predict.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Support Vector Machines or k-nearest neighbours\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **When you incorporate regularization.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization behaves differently for different scaling: Suppose you have an ‚Ñì2 regularization on the problem above. It is easy to see that ‚Ñì2 regularization pushes larger weights towards zero more strongly than smaller weights. So consider that you obtain some optimal values of ùë§1 and ùë§2 using your given unnormalized data matrix ùëã. Now instead of using ùëö2 as the unit of area, if I change the data to represent area in ùëìùë°2, the corresponding column of X will get multiplied by a factor of ~10. Therefore, you would expect the corresponding optimal coefficient ùë§2 to go down by a factor of 10 to maintain the value of y. But, as stated before, the ‚Ñì2 regularization now has a smaller effect because of the smaller value of the coefficient. So you will end up getting a larger value of ùë§2 than you would have expected. This does not make sense ‚Äî you did not change the information content of the data, and therefore, your optimal coefficients should not have changed."
